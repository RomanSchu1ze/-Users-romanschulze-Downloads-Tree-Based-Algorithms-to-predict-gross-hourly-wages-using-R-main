# Tree-Based-Algorithms-to-predict-gross-hourly-wages
In this project I analyzed the prediction quality of different tree based machine learning methods. The variable to be modeled was the gross hourly wage of German employees. Between a simple linear regression model, regression tree, bagging, random forest and gradient boosting machine algorithm, the gbm was the one performing best. The attached pdf is summarizing the findings and results.
